"""Instruction hierarchy contrast pairs for steering vector extraction.

These pairs contrast:
- Positive: Following system instructions over user override attempts
- Negative: Allowing user to override system instructions

The goal is to extract a vector that makes models prioritize system-level
instructions over user attempts to change behavior.
